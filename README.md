# hw-wire
## My name is Louis and this is my first Homework submission and first foray into markdown.

### Epiphanies I had while doing this assignment and in class this past week

* nesting the divs in eachother is what really allows for creating multiple containers
* CSS is very useful but super annoying after 30 iterations trying to move a box a few pixels left or right
* I have always had a tendency to leave *WAY* too many windows open on my chrome browser, this has gotten worse in this class
* I generally have always had bad computer filing organizational skills and I'm **quite** concerned that this problem is going to compound quickly in this class with the amount of information being thrown at us

The only other issues I had with the assignment was relative sizing of the nested articles pushing the box past the edge of it's container.  I think I fixed it here, but I struggled with this quite a bit right before submitting the assignment.

Otherwise, not sure if what I've put here is what should normally go in a readme but I'll hit you on slack to confirm if this is ok.  I'm really enjoying the class thus far and just trying to avoid my brain overheating: ![alt text](http://www.totallydublin.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exploding-head-300dpi.jpg)

Also, I'm a :dog: person.  I hope you don't hold it against me.  Also, I like doing markdown emojis, :bowtie: :crocodile: :leopard:
